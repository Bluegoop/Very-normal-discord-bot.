# Very-normal-discord-bot.
Definetly wasn't made to just spam memes and messages to people.

# Instructions (coz ik u need it)
Step 1: Make a discord bot. Should be easy (if you didn't skip past my video and you actually watched it...)

Step 2: Make a server and invite the bot.

Step 3: Copy the bot token, and paste it in the "file.env" file.

Step 4: Go in a terminal, and run "pip install discord requests os dotenv".

Step 5: Replace line 13 with the path to the file.env.

Step 6: Find the channel ID by right-clicking on the channel, then copy the channel ID. Paste it in line 31 and 47.

Step 7: When using the /spam_text_coz_y_not, to get the userID of the dude you wanna troll, right-click on the user and copy the userID. Paste it in the userid placeholder.

Step 8: Done :)
